- **Tailwind CSS**: Implements responsive and modern UI design

### 2. Backend Services
- **Supabase**: 
  - Database management
  - Authentication system
  - Real-time updates
  - File storage for thumbnails

### 3. External APIs
- **YouTube Data API**: 
  - Fetches video metadata
  - Validates video URLs
  - Retrieves thumbnails

- Dynamic subject and chapter creation by admins
- Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions

#### Playlist Management
- Status-based organization (Pending/Approved)
- Automatic metadata extraction from YouTube URLs
- Thumbnail generation and storage

### 2. Admin Dashboard
#### Authentication System
- Secure admin login using Supabase auth
- Session management with local storage
- Protected routes implementation

#### Content Moderation
- Playlist approval workflow
- Content editing capabilities
- Bulk management features

### 3. User Interface
#### Navigation System
- Responsive navbar with dynamic routing
- Tab-based interface in admin panel
- Breadcrumb navigation for subjects/chapters

#### Content Display
- Grid-based playlist layout
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Lazy loading for optimal performance

## Database Schema

### 1. Tables
#### Admins
- id: uuid (primary key)
- username: string
- password_hash: string
- created_at: timestamp

#### Subjects
- id: uuid (primary key)
- name: string
- created_at: timestamp

#### Chapters
- id: uuid (primary key)
- subject_id: uuid (foreign key)
- name: string
- created_at: timestamp

#### Playlists
- id: uuid (primary key)
- title: string
- url: string
- thumbnail_url: string
- status: enum (pending/approved)
- subject_id: uuid (foreign key)
- chapter_id: uuid (foreign key)
- created_at: timestamp

## Security Implementation

### 1. Authentication
- Secure password hashing
- JWT-based session management
- Protected API routes

### 2. Data Protection
- Environment variable management
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS protection

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Frontend
- Image optimization

- Dynamic imports
- Cached API responses

### 2. Database
- Indexed queries
- Optimized joins
- Connection pooling

## User Workflows

### 1. Admin Flow
1. Login to admin panel
2. Manage subjects and chapters
3. Review pending playlists
4. Approve/Decline submissions
5. Edit existing content

### 2. Student Flow
1. Browse subjects
2. Select chapters
3. View curated playlists
4. Submit new playlist requests

## Future Enhancements
